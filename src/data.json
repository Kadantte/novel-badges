It’s different from the series which I grew up watching when I was much younger, but I like the vibe, I like the characters and maybe, just maybe one day, we can see the Gridman return to live action, may it be film or a television series.  But the return of “Gridman” as an anime series and keeping the “Gridman” name live once again, definitely makes this series worth watching!",

Unfortunately, she suffers from extreme social anxiety: she faints when overwhelmed, vomits when nervous, and draws up ridiculously convoluted plans to avoid social contact. It does not help that her only friend from elementary school, Kai Yawara, will not be attending the same middle school as Bocchi. However, wanting to help her, Kai severs ties with Bocchi and promises to reconcile with her when she befriends all of her classmates in her new middle school class.",
